**Problem Statement:**
Stock market movements are challenging to analyze if not visualized. Investors and analysts need graphical representations of stock price movements, trading volumes, and correlations in order to make sound decisions. This project will produce useful charts in Excel from historical stock data to examine Apple Inc.'s stock performance.
